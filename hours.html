    <h3 id="info">Sleeping Information</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">With our newfound knowledge of sleep cycles, we can nou understand how the amount of sleep has a large effect on the brain! Feel free to scroll through all the effects together, or check out the <a href="index.html">home</a> page to select a certain hour!<br><br>Here's a breakdown of the effects:</p>

    <h3 id="zero" style="text-align: left;">0 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Realistically, you should aim to never be in this situation, however choosing to do so will result in EXTREME levels of cognitive decline. Did you know? Going more than 24 hours without a single drop of sleep is comparable to having a blood alcohol level (BAC) of 0.1%? You will also experience high irritability, impared judgement and decreased coordination. This also poses health risks, such as prolonged sleep deprivation that can lead to serious health issues, including weakened immune function and increased risk of chronic diseases.</p>

    <h3 id="onepointfive" style="text-align: left;">1.5 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of sleeping stage, you have completed one full sleep cycle which includes light, deep and REM sleep. There are minimal benefits to this, such as some temporary relief from extreme sleepiness but will not be sufficient for a full restoration. This stage is not adequate for optimal cognitive and physical performance.</p>

    <h3 id="three" style="text-align: left;">3 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This level of sleep means that 2 sleep cycles have been successfully completed. This amount is better than 1.5 hours, as it offers more restorative sleep stages. This amount of sleep isn't perfect however, as it falls short of the recommended sleeping amount for adults.</p>

    <h3 id="fourpointfive" style="text-align: left;">4.5 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At 4.5 hours, 3 sleep cycles have finished. This level of sleep increases alertness and mood compared to shorter durations. This amount of sleep is still not safe to recommend, as chronic sleep restriction to this duration can lead to cumulative sleep debt and associated health risks.</p>

    <h3 id="six" style="text-align: left;">6 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As we reach the 6 hour mark, our sleep gets healthier. 4 fully completed sleep cycles is expected from this. Despite seeming relatively low, 6 hours may suffice for a certain demographic in the short-term. Although close, 6 hours of sleep is still below the recommendation for sleep and can impair cognitive function, increase stress and elevate the risk of chronic conditions.</p>

    <h3 id="sevenpointfive" style="text-align: left;">7.5 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A very common length of sleep, five full sleep cycles are completed at this stage. 7 and a half hours aligns with the lower end of the recommended sleep duration for adults, supporting optimal cognitive and physical health. 7.5 hours offers an optimal wake up time, often coinciding with lighter sleep stages, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed.

    <h3 id="nine" style="text-align: left;">9 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The most optimal of this list, 9 hours completes six full sleep cycles. A long 9 hours offers comprehensive restorative sleep, enhancing memory consolidation, mood regulation, and overall health. This amount of sleep is ideal for individuals with higher sleep needs, such as teenagers or those who are sick.

    <h3 id="tenpointfive" style="text-align: left;">10.5 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">10 and a half hours may be beneficial occasionally, especially after periods of sleep deprivation. Note that regularly exceeding 10 hours of sleep can be associated with health issues like depression, obesity, and increased mortality risk.</p>

    <h3 id="twelve" style="text-align: left;">12 Hours</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">12 hours of sleep may be dangerous. Consistently sleeping more than 12 hours may signal underlying health problems, such as sleep disorders or depression. Chronic oversleeping is linked to increased risks of diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline.</p>
